    "\n",
    "Alain Desrosieres argues that the central tension in histories examining the role of statistics in political discourse is that the statistical entities that statistics uses are both real and fabrications: real in that they must be taken as “uncontestable standards” of reference insofar as they serve as  compelling evidence for a particular claim; fabrications in that they are the result of “the provisional and fragile crowning of a series of conventions of equivalence between entities.”[1] The statistical entity of life expectancy, for instance, is real insofar as it serves as a proxy for the health of populations and individuals, and is used to justify disparities in health and life insurance pricing and coverage for different populations. Yet in calculating life expectancy, one quickly discovers not a single computational method, but hundreds--each with a different set of assumptions that yield different results. Deciding which life expectancy estimation to employ is tied up with what the measure will be used to do, and so involves political, ethical, and even moral decisions about who and what should be counted and excluded.[2] \n",
    "\n",
    "Tracing the historical transformation of a statistical entity from a contingent, context-sensitive description into a “universal” property provides insight into the political institutions that created it while also making legible the ways in which a statistical entity exerted a reciprocal pressure back upon the institutions and individuals that created them.[3] Exploring the political implications of statistical entities is further complicated by their historical tendency to be repurposed for use in new arguments. While life expectancy was developed for assigning and categorizing individuals according to their likelihood of death while their life insurance policy was in force, this statistical category was subsequently put to more sinister purposes: namely, to “demonstrate” the existence of racial biological characteristics and then to serve as “evidence” that race was an appropriate category for screening immigrants.[4]\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Our immediate objective is to get some practice using Pandas to explore a data set, but we also want to be mindful of the implicit assumptions using this data entails.</b> The data you'll be using was obtained at http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688 via the World Health Organization website. You can find a discussion of how they tabulate life expectancy in this PDF[http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/LT_method_1990_2012.pdf] for each country. In many cases, the life expectancies for different countries are not equally reliable. To wit, for many countries life expectancies were inferred rather than being observed directly. Both the sources and amounts of error can be very different for different countries. Furthermore, life expectancy as calculated by WHO may not match the \"official\" life expectancy values as calculated by each country. If you want to make any claims regarding the data you're about to explore, you would first need to know what methods, data, and politics were involved in producing a life expectancy measurement for each country you're examining. As you perform some basic EDA below, ask yourself if the comparisons you're being asked to perform are ethical. For what decisions and contexts would such comparisons be unethical?\n",
